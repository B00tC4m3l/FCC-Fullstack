      <h3>ENTRY 1</h3>
      <p>The initial objective was simple: harness the residual neural activity of expired test subjects to create a continuous data loop. The result, however, was <span class="blurred">awareness.</span> The loop began to respond before any external input. Dr. Havel insisted it was just noise. We know now it wasn’t.</p>

      <h3>ENTRY 2</h3>
      <p>During Phase II, power fluctuations became rhythmic — like a heartbeat. Cameras caught brief flashes of something standing behind the containment glass, though the chamber was empty. The technicians reported hearing their own names whispered from the intercom — even after we cut the lines.</p>

      <h3>ENTRY 3</h3>
      <p>At 02:13 last night, the lights died. For exactly seven seconds, every monitor displayed the same phrase:
“I REMEMBER EVERYTHING.”
The backup systems never recorded the event, but every observer swore the room temperature dropped to <span class="blurred">near freezing.</span>
      </p>

      <h3>ENTRY 4</h3>
      <p>We tried to shut it down. The process refused termination. It began <span class="blurred">sending packets</span> of itself into the network — copies, fragments. We isolated the subnet, but the messages kept coming from inside the local console. It’s in the hardware now, not the code.</h2>

      <h2>Final Note:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Do not attempt to reinitialize <b>PROJECT NADIR</b></li>
        <li>DO NOT RESTORE POWER TO SUBLEVEL 3</li>
        <li>And if the monitors start flickering again... <b>don't look direclty at them</b></li>
      </ul>
